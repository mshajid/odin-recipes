So far, I followed the exactly as The Odin Project said in the assignment, 
No fancy stuffs added, Since I did only the HTML part so far, even though I knew little bit css, but
I didn't want to make fancier as long as I bounded with the instructions. 
As per with the useful resource links and the study materials, I was able to create this recipe site at ease, and 
i got into trouble with relative path, and had to fix the bug that took me 15 minutes to figure out. 

Thank You! Odin ;)
